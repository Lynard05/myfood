# myfood
Visualization of nutrient data from common foods using Python 3, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Shown in Jupyter Notebook
   
 ___Introduction___
 
The code enclosed within the attached Jupyter Notebook files is my first experience with using pandas and matplotlib. CSV data is loaded into a dataframe using using pandas, then creating visulaizations. 

The CSV file has changed overtime, dating back several years before I had learned any programming skills. Originally the CSV was made up of commonly purchased non processed foods with nutrient data and prices from different grocery stores and online marketplaces. Eventually I added some other less common plant based foods that I do not commonly purchase or eat.

The goal of the attached code is to create dataframes, visualizations, and analysis about the relationship between different foods and:

- nutrients per serving
- nutrients per gram
- the cost of each nutrient per gram

The visualizations serve as the variety of ways nutrient data can be considered when selecting what foods are best to consume. This is a working document that I will update as my skills improve. Besides serving as a hands on learning experience, the results obtained have and will continue to shape my families dietary decisions.
