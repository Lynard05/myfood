# myfood
Visualization of nutrient data from common foods using Python 3, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Shown in Jupyter Notebook
   
 ___Introduction___
 
The code enclosed within the attached Jupyter Notebook files is my first experience with using pandas and matplotlib. CSV data is loaded into a dataframe using using pandas, then visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn.

The CSV file has changed overtime, dating back several years before I had learned any programming skills. Originally the CSV was made up of commonly purchased non processed foods with nutrient data and prices from different grocery stores and online marketplaces. Eventually I added some other less common plant based foods that I do not commonly purchase or eat.

After using the Fooducate app but found its nutrient tracking to be quite weak, only offering a few vitamins beyond the general macronutrients. I began looking at different nutrients and their relative abundance per gram rather then per serving.


The goal of the attached code is to create dataframes, visualizations, and analysis about the relationship between different foods and:

- nutrients per serving
- nutrients per gram
- the cost of each nutrient per gram

The visualizations serve as the variety of ways nutrient data can be considered when selecting what foods are best to consume. This is a working document that will be updated as my skills improve. Besides serving as a hands on learning experience, the results obtained have and will continue to shape my families dietary decisions.
